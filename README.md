The binary search can search a integer in a sorted integer vector. Firstly we find an element in the middle and compare it with the given integer. If equal, the element is what we want. If the element is smaller, we choose the right part and do the above step again. If the element is bigger, we choose the left part and do the above step again. we follow these steps until we get the integer we want.
